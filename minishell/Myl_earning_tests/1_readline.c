// the readline function is likely provided by the Readline library, which offers advanced line-editing capabilities in the terminal. This library simplifies the process of reading input lines from the user and provides features like command history, tab-completion, and line editing.

// To use the readline function in your "minishell" project, you will need to include the appropriate header file and link against the Readline library during the compilation process.

// Here's a brief example demonstrating the usage of the readline function:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <readline/readline.h>
#include <readline/history.h>

int main() {
    char* input;

    // Readline loop
    while ((input = readline("minishell> ")) != NULL) {
        // Process the input here
        printf("You entered: %s\n", input);

        // Add the input to the history
        add_history(input);

        // Free the input buffer allocated by readline
        free(input);
    }

    return 0;
}
// In the example above, we include the necessary header files for readline and history from the Readline library. Inside the main loop, we call readline("minishell> ") to prompt the user for input and read a line. The entered line is stored in the input variable as a dynamically allocated string.

// After processing the input, we add it to the history using the add_history function, allowing the user to access previously entered commands using the arrow keys. Finally, we free the memory allocated by readline by calling free on the input variable.

// Note that you will need to compile the program with the appropriate flags to link against the Readline library. For example, you may use a command like gcc minishell.c -o minishell -lreadline to compile and link your "minishell" program.
